>Do research in the big model time

The era of big models is upon us. Big models are large-scale neural networks that can perform a variety of tasks, such as natural language understanding, computer vision, speech recognition, and more. Big models are trained on massive amounts of data and require enormous computational resources to run. Some examples of big models are GPT-3, BERT, DALL-E, and CLIP.

But how can researchers keep up with the rapid pace of innovation and discovery in the big model time? How can they design, train, evaluate, and deploy big models effectively and efficiently? In this blog post, I will share some tips and best practices for doing research in the big model time.

Tip 1: Define the research question clearly and precisely

Before you start working on a big model, you need to have a clear and precise research question that guides your work. What problem are you trying to solve? What is the motivation and significance of your work? What are the expected outcomes and impacts of your work? Having a well-defined research question will help you narrow down your scope, focus your efforts, and avoid unnecessary distractions.

Tip 2: Review the existing literature and state-of-the-art methods

Before you start building a big model, you need to review the existing literature and state-of-the-art methods related to your research question. What are the current challenges and limitations of the existing methods? What are the gaps and opportunities for improvement? How can you leverage the existing methods or build upon them? Reviewing the literature will help you gain a deeper understanding of the problem domain, identify the relevant baselines and benchmarks, and formulate your research hypothesis.

Tip 3: Choose an appropriate big model architecture and framework

Once you have a clear research question and a solid literature review, you need to choose an appropriate big model architecture and framework for your work. There are many different types of big models, such as transformers, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, etc. Each type of big model has its own strengths and weaknesses, depending on the task and data. You need to choose a big model architecture that suits your research question and data characteristics.

You also need to choose a framework that supports your big model architecture and provides the necessary tools and libraries for building, training, testing, and deploying your big model. There are many frameworks available for working with big models, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc. Each framework has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the features, performance, scalability, usability, etc. You need to choose a framework that meets your research needs and preferences.

Tip 4: Acquire and preprocess your data carefully

Data is the fuel for big models. Big models require large amounts of high-quality data to learn from and perform well. Therefore, you need to acquire and preprocess your data carefully before feeding it to your big model. You need to collect data that is relevant, representative, diverse, balanced, and unbiased for your research question. You also need to preprocess your data to make it suitable for your big model architecture and framework. You may need to perform tasks such as cleaning, filtering, labeling, augmenting, tokenizing, embedding, etc. on your data.


Doing research in the age of big models requires treating it as a tool rather than a threat. Big models can help us solve complex problems, improve efficiency and innovation, but they also bring some challenges and risks, such as data security, model interpretability, social responsibility, etc. Therefore, as researchers, we should follow the principles of science and ethical standards, have a clear understanding and planning of our research purposes and methods, and also pay attention to the impact of big models on society and the environment, and actively seek multi-party cooperation and communication to promote the healthy development and sustainable use of big models.
